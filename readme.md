# Practice Database Design

## Introduction

To practice modeling databases, you'll be tasked with drawing ERDs for a handful of hypothetical applications. Think about what models you would need and what tables you'd create, including the associated attributes and how they would related to other tables.

Break into groups of three and work together to draw out diagrams for one of the apps below. You'll be drawing on the wall, so snap photos of the drawings when you've finished for safe keeping.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

1. Pick one of the following in your group:

  - an app to run a grocery store
  - an app to run an airline
  - an app to run a school
  - an app to run a team of developers

2. Write a short description of what your app does

3. Draw out the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

### ERD Example:
