# Practice Database Design

## Introduction

To practice modeling databases, you'll be tasked with drawing ERDs for a handful of hypothetical applications. Think about what models you would need and what tables you'd create, including the associated attributes and how they would related to other tables.

For this assignment, you will be require to built out an ERD with at least three tables (not including join tables). You must also have at least one association in your ERD.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

1. Pick one of the following in your ERD:

  - an app to run a grocery store
  - an app to run an airline
  - an app to run a music player
  - an app to run a team of developers

2. Write a short description of what your app does

3. Draw out the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

### ERD Example:

> Note: this example has "Items" as placeholders for the attributes. You should fill in the attributes with whatever columns you think your tables need.
